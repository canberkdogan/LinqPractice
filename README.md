LINQ Exercise in C#
Objective
The goal of this exercise is to create a list of 10 random integers and perform various LINQ queries on the list. We will filter the list based on specific conditions and perform some transformations.

Requirements
A list of 10 random integers will be generated.
Use LINQ queries to:
Find even numbers.
Find odd numbers.
Find negative numbers.
Find positive numbers.
Find numbers greater than 15 and less than 22.
Create a new list with the squares of each number from the original list.
Steps
Create a List of Random Numbers:

Generate 10 random integers and store them in a list.
Perform LINQ Queries:

Even Numbers: Use LINQ to filter and display all even numbers in the list.
Odd Numbers: Use LINQ to filter and display all odd numbers in the list.
Negative Numbers: Use LINQ to filter and display all negative numbers in the list.
Positive Numbers: Use LINQ to filter and display all positive numbers in the list.
Numbers Greater than 15 and Less than 22: Use LINQ to find and display all numbers greater than 15 and less than 22.
Squares of Numbers: Create a new list that contains the square of each number from the original list using LINQ.
